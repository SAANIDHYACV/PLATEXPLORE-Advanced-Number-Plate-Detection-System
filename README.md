# PLATEXPLORE-Advanced-Number-Plate-Detection-System
Platexplore: Advanced Number Plate Detection System, developed during a data science internship. The objective of this project was to create an efficient, reliable, and user-friendly system for detecting and extracting vehicle license plate information using a combination of advanced image processing and optical character recognition (OCR) techniques. The system aims to address real-world challenges in areas such as traffic monitoring, automated parking management, and vehicle tracking for enhanced security.

The project employed OpenCV for image preprocessing and number plate detection, utilizing methods such as edge detection, contour analysis, and filtering techniques to isolate license plates from images or video frames. The extracted plate regions were then processed using PyTesseract to perform OCR, converting the alphanumeric characters into machine-readable text with high accuracy. To ensure seamless storage and retrieval of extracted data, SQL was utilized for database management. The system was further enhanced by developing an interactive and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, enabling users to interact with the application easily. Additionally, NumPy was extensively used for handling numerical computations, matrix operations, and data preprocessing to improve processing efficiency.
